abstract: "<p>Recall that, for a set $A$ of regular cardinals, we define 

$$&#92;operatorname{pcf}(A) := &#92;{&#92;operatorname{cf}(&#92;prod A/D): D &#92;text{ is an ultrafilter on A}&#92;}.$$

In the case when $A$ is an interval of regular cardinals satisfying $|A|<&#92;min (A)$, we can say quite a bit about how $&#92;operatorname{pcf}(A)$ behaves. For example, we know that $&#92;operatorname{pcf}(&#92;operatorname{pcf}(A))=&#92;operatorname{pcf}(A)$, and that we can get transitive generators for all $&#92;lambda &#92;in &#92;operatorname{pcf}(A)$. We might then as ourselves what we can say if we remove one or both assumptions of these assumptions on $A$. That is, are there other assumptions under which $&#92;operatorname{pcf}(A)$ is well behaved?</p>
<p>
Throughout this talk, I will survey some of the literature regarding this question, and discuss a number of important open questions.
