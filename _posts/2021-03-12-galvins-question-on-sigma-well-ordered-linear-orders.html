abstract: "
<p>Assume $&#92;mathcal{C}$ is the class of all linear orders $L$ such that $L$ is not a countable union of well ordered sets, and every uncountable subset of $L$ contains a copy of $&#92;omega_1$.  We show it is consistent that $&#92;mathcal{C}$ has minimal elements.   This answers an old question due to Galvin.</p>
