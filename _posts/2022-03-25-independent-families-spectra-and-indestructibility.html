abstract: "
<p>Independent families are families of infinite sets of integers
with the property that for any two disjoint, non-empty, finite
subfamilies $A$ and $B$ of the given family,
the set $&#92;bigcap A&#92;backslash &#92;bigcup B$ is infinite. Of particular
interest are the sets of the possible
cardinalities of maximal independent families, as well as their
indestructibility by various forcing notions.
In this talk, we will consider some recent advances in the area and
point out to remaining open questions.
