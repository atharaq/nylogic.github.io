abstract: "
<p>In this talk  we investigate generic automorphisms of countable models.  Hodges-Hodkinson-Lascar- Shelah 93 introduces the notion of SI (small index) generic automorphisms which are used to show the small index property. Truss 92 defines the notion of Truss generic automorphisms.  We study the relationship between these two types of generic automorphisms.</p>
