abstract: "
The Ultrapower Axiom UA, introduced by Goldberg and Woodin, is
known to have many striking consequences. In particular, Goldberg has shown
that assuming UA, the Mitchell ordering of normal measures over a measurable
cardinal is linear. I will discuss how this result may be used to construct choiceless
models of ZF in which the number of normal measures at successors of singular
cardinals can be precisely controlled.
