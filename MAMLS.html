<p>
The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar is an ongoing program of grass-roots meetings in mathematical logic in the northeastern United States.  It is funded by grant #DMS-1834219 from the National Science Foundation, which provides travel support for speakers, students, and researchers without other means of support, so that they can attend MAMLS meetings.  The Principal Investigator for this grant is Prof. Russell Miller, of Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, and the grant is administered by the Research Foundation of CUNY.  For many years, Prof. Arthur Apter was the mainstay of the MAMLS grant, and we salute his efforts through those years.

<p>
The meetings funded by MAMLS include several recurring conference series:  the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar (NERDS), the NorthEast Regional Model Theory Days (NERMTD), and the annual Rutgers Logic Meeting.  In addition, wild-card MAMLS meetings take place intermittently.  Below we provide a list of recent and upcoming meetings funded by MAMLS.  Students and others who wish to apply for MAMLS funding to attend one of these meetings should initiate the process by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:Russell.Miller@qc.cuny.edu">Russell Miller</a>.
