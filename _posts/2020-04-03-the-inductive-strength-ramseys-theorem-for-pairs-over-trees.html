abstract: "Ramsey's theorem for pairs over trees ($TT^2_2$) states that every two-coloring of pairs of comparable nodes in the full binary tree induces a monochromatic isomorphic subtree, i.e. an isomorphic subtree all of whose pairs of comparable nodes share the same color. This is a natural analog of the classical Ramsey's theorem for pairs (of natural numbers). A basic problem in reverse mathematics concerns investigating the first-order proof-theoretic strength of $TT^2_2$. In this talk, we consider this problem with particular focus on the inductive strength. The main result states that over  the base system $RCA_0$, $TT^2_2$ does not prove $&#92;Sigma_2$-induction. This is joint work with Wei Li, Lu Liu and Yue Yang."
