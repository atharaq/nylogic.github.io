abstract: "<p>
The $&#92;Sigma$-definability on HF(R) (the hereditarily finite superstructure over R) is one of possible natural extensions of the concept of computability to the real numbers. It leads to a natural generalization of the notion of computable structure, namely, to the notion of $&#92;Sigma$-definable structures over HF(R), which enables us to consider uncountable analogs of computable structures. We prove that the least uncountable ordinal $&#92;omega_1$ cannot be embedded into any preordering $&#92;Sigma$-definable with parameters in HF(R). As a corollary, we obtain a description for $&#92;Sigma$-definable ordinals and Goedel's constructive sets of kind $L_&#92;alpha$ and prove that there is no $&#92;Sigma$--presentations of the degree structures for $T$-, $m$-, $1$-, and $tt$-reducibilities over the natural numbers.
